    0: "Summon Spell Revisions for ACN - Katherine Taylor(Cheetah)\n\nThis Book was
      last updated on 28th March 2008.\n\nThe special summoning system I designed
      gives your creatures bonus stats. The bonus stats are: AB/AC/Saves/Damage Bonus/HP
      Bonus. There are 7 levels of summon bonuses.\n<cу у>For every 10 levels of caster
      after level 5, you get 1 \"Bonus\" level towards summon bonuses.\nFor each Spell
      Focus Conjuration feat, you also get +1 for each.\n\nEpic Spell Focus: Conjuration
      activates certain other summon abilities, such as a special summon with Summon
      Creature IX.</c>\n\nThese spells have been changed:\n\n<cу у>Summon Creature
      I to IX </c>\n<cюf > These creatures are much more powerful now and based on
      your Good - Evil alignment. Summon Creature IX will summon a special, more powerful
      creature if you have ::Epic Spell Focus - Conjuration::\nAnimal domain clerics
      get each summon spell earlier. </c>\n\n<cу у>Shelgarn's Persistant Blade </c>\n<cюf
      >Summons a dagger at levels 1-9, a katana otherwise.\nAt level 5 the dagger
      gains 1d4 sonic damage.\nAt level 10 the dagger gains 2d4 sonic damage.\nAt
      level 15+ the dagger gains 2d8 sonic damage. </c>\n\n<cу у>Elemental Swarm (Druid)
      </c>\n<cюf >Summons 4 Elemental creatures when the creature dies. \nThere's
      a 1 in 20 chance that the 2nd/3rd/4th creatures will be of the \"special\" variety.\n::Epic
      Spell Focus - Conjuration:: increases the odds of getting a special summon,
      1 in 6.</c>\n\n<cу у>Planar Binding Series </c>\n<cюf >The creatures summoned
      are more powerful and have unique characteristics based on alignment. \nThis
      spell loses the \"Hold Outsider\" ability when targetted at any Outsider. (Use
      Hold Monster or whatever instead)</c>\n\n<cу у>Black Blade of Disaster </c>\n<cюf
      >This is now a much more damaging summon to use. You will need to maintain concentration
      still.\nDeals 1d8 extra magical damage at level 25\nDeals 2d8 extra magical
      damage at level 30\nDeals 2d8 extra magical and negative damage at level 35\nEpic
      Conjuration Users: 2d12 extra electrical damage\n\nBlack Blade of Disaster is
      no longer invulnerable.</c>\n\n<cу у>Gate </c>\n<cюf >This spell summons either
      a Balor, Pitfiend or Catapalon based on if you are Evil, Neutral or Good. These
      summons should be more powerful than the summon creature IX summons. It lasts
      less time however. \n\nMake sure you have protection versus alignment already
      cast, these summons are powerful! For neutral alignments, they can cast either
      of the two Protection From Alignment spells.\n\nIf you have Epic Spell Focus:
      Conjuration, you don't need protective spells.</c>\n\nPost bugs and summon suggestions
      on the appropiate forum thread.\n\nVersion 1.05\n- Cheetah (Katherine Taylor)\n"
